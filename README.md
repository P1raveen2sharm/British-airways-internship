# British-airways-internship

The project focuses on analyzing British Airways' operational data to enhance efficiency and optimize decision-making. The business objective is to identify key factors influencing flight delays, passenger satisfaction, and overall airline performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, the goal is to improve service reliability, streamline operations, and enhance customer experience.

The problem-solving benefits include better resource allocation, reduced operational costs, improved on-time performance, and higher customer satisfaction. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), patterns in delays, customer feedback, and operational inefficiencies were uncovered. Key insights from the data helped in identifying factors such as weather conditions, flight routes, aircraft type, and peak travel times that significantly impact airline performance.

For feature selection, relevant attributes influencing flight punctuality and passenger satisfaction were chosen using statistical techniques, correlation analysis, and domain expertise. Advanced techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature importance from machine learning models were used to refine the dataset and improve model efficiency.

The project utilized various tools and technologies, including Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn), SQL for data querying, and machine learning models for predictive analysis. These technologies enabled effective data processing, visualization, and model building to derive actionable insights.

Overall, the project provides valuable recommendations for British Airways to enhance operational efficiency, minimize delays, and improve customer service based on data-driven decision-making.
